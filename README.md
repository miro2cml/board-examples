# Example Boards for miro2cml

This repository contains the Miro Example Boards for the miro2cml application. For each template exists at least one Example Board. 

### How to use it

The boards saved in the folders have the ".rtb" file extension. Boards in this format can be easily imported back into Miro. To do this, simply use the "Upload from Backup" button in the dashboard. Now you just have to select the desired file. Miro now loads the board from the ".rtb" - file and creates a new board with the name: "Restored {name of the board saved in the file}".
